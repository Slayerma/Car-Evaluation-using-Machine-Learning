# Car-Evaluation-using-Machine-Learning
This project builds a predictive model for car acceptability using machine learning techniques like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost. The workflow covers data preprocessing, analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The XGBoost with SMOTE and Stacking Ensemble models achieved the best accuracy.
